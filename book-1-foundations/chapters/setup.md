# Computer Setup

## Hardware

Up until now, you didn't have the power to destroy your machine, but within the first two weeks of attending Nashville Software School you will have that power. Go buy a backup drive RIGHT NOW and start backing up your entire hard drive.

**Seriously, right now!**

## Installs For Everyone
### Install Slack

Do not use the browser-based interface for Slack. [Download](https://slack.com/downloads/) and use the client. Let us know if you did not get an invitation to the Nashville Software School Slack organization, and we'll send you one immediately.

### Google Chrome

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) is the most popular browser for web developers because of the powerful tools it provides to test code, manipulate documents, and measure performance.

### Online Services

#### Github

Github is the primary site that software developers throughout the world use to store their code, and share it with other developers. Visit the [sign up page](https://github.com/join) and create your own, free account.
