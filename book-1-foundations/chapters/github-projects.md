# Github Projects

> Project boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs.

Check out this [guide to planning a programming project](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/good-practices/a/planning-a-programming-project) to get a general sense of what you should be thinking about when planning your project.

In this class, we will be using [Github Projects](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) to plan each of our projects (whether they be individiual or group assignments).
