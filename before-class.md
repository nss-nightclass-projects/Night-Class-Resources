# HW Week 0 - Things to do before class!!!

In a few short days we'll start our journey together to learn the basics of modern front-end web development. In the interest of getting off to a running start, here are some things that you can do to help the instruction team.

Start at the top of this list and work your way down.  Things are listed in priority order.  Finish #1 below before you go on to #2 and so on and so forth.

## General Admin Things
1. Complete this form: [General Information](https://forms.gle/GxPgRN5hD8iknWR38)

## Installs
1. Install Google Chrome if you haven't already
1. Visit [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and sign up with the same email address you gave to NSS
1. Download the [Zoom Client For Meetings](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting) and login to your zoom account there as well
1. [Mac Installs](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/mac-installs.md)
1. Windows Installs
    - [Python Cohorts: Installations for Windows](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/GETTING_STARTED_WINDOWS.md)
    - [C# Cohorts: Installations for Windows](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/GETTING_STARTED_WINDOWS_C_SHARP.md)
1. Create a [github account](https://github.com).  Future employers will see this and you don't want to change it (git history is important) so think carefully about what username you choose.  For almost all students I suggest just going with some version of your first and last name.
1. Add your photo to slack **and** github.  Of your face - NOT your cat, dog, dinosaur, or BFF.  Your real face...semi recently.

If you have any questions, drop them in the cohort slack channel.

## Prework
1. [Prework](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/webdev-foundations-course/) - This should be your final push to get all the prework done. Ask questions in slack, answer questions in slack, and generally try to help each other out!

## First Day Stuff!!!
We'll share the zoom call information through slack. The call will be scheduled to start at 5:30 on the first night of class, 30 minutes before class time, which should give everybody enough time to make sure they are able to join. If you have any issues, make some noise! We can't help if we don't know.
