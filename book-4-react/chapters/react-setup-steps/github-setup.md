# Github Setup with react
Now that we have our beginning files in place we need to create a github repo and push things up in a very particular order.  `create-react-app` has already done a git init, built a README.md, and done an add and commit for us.  We just need to link our local repo to a github repo and push.

## On github
* Create a github repo - DO NOT initialize with a readme or gitignore.
* Think back to the start of class: this is what we did way back then, right? So it's nothing new, it's just been a minute

## On your local machine
* `git remote add origin <ADD SSH STUFF HERE>` (that you copied from the page after creating the repo, remember?)
* `git push -u origin main`

You should now have all the create-react-app stuff pushed up to github
